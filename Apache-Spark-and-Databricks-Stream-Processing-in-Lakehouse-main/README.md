<h2> Description </h2>
<p align="justify">
  I am creating Apache Spark and Databricks - Stream Processing in Lakehouse using the Python Language and PySpark API. This course will help you understand Real-time Stream processing using Apache Spark and Databricks Cloud and apply that knowledge to build real-time stream processing solutions. This course is example-driven and follows a working session-like approach. We will take a live coding approach and explain all the needed concepts.
</p>

<h3>Capstone Project</h3>
<p align="justify">
This course also includes an End-To-End Capstone project. The project will help you understand the real-life project design, coding, implementation, testing, and CI/CD approach. 
</p>

<h3>Who should take this Course?</h3>
<p align="justify">
I designed this course for software engineers willing to develop a Real-time Stream Processing Pipeline and application using Apache Spark. I am also creating this course for data architects and data engineers who are responsible for designing and building the organizationâ€™s data-centric infrastructure. Another group of people is the managers and architects who do not directly work with Spark implementation. Still, they work with those implementing Apache Spark at the ground level.
</p>

<h3>Spark and source code version</h3>
<p align="justify">
This Course is using the Apache Spark 3.5. I have tested all the source code and examples used in this Course on Azure Databricks Cloud using Databricks Runtime 14.1.
